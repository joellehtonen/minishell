## ‚ú® Features  

Minishell includes the following functionalities:  

### General Behavior
- Displays a prompt when waiting for user input.
- Maintains a working command history.
- Searches and executes the correct binaries using the `PATH` variable, or via relative/absolute paths.

### Quote Handling
- Single quotes (`'`) disable interpretation of special characters.
- Double quotes (`"`) allow interpretation of `$` (dollar sign) while disabling others.  

### Redirections  
- `<` redirects input.  
- `>` redirects output.  
- `<<` (heredoc) reads input until a delimiter is reached (not added to history).  
- `>>` appends output.  

### Pipelines
- Implements pipes (`|`) to connect commands in a sequence.  

### Environment Variables
- Expands variables prefixed with `$`.  
- Supports `$?` to retrieve the exit status of the last executed command.  

### Signal Handling  
- `ctrl-C`: Displays a new prompt on a new line.  
- `ctrl-D`: Exits the shell.  
- `ctrl-\`: Does nothing (interactive mode).  

### Built-in Commands
- **`echo`**: Includes the `-n` option.  
- **`cd`**: Accepts relative or absolute paths.  
- **`pwd`**: Prints the current directory.  
- **`export`**: Sets environment variables.  
- **`unset`**: Removes environment variables.  
- **`env`**: Displays environment variables.  
- **`exit`**: Exits the shell.
