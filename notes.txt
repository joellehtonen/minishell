BUILTINS: 
- need to be able export or unset many at the same time

LEAKS:
- valgrind --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all --track-origins=yes --trace-children=yes --track-fds=yes --suppressions=readline.supp ./minishell

FIXED: if cd into directory and removing an upper directory, handle it somehow

export | grep 'HOME 
this doesnt work

put env in alphabetical order?

< Makefile ""
this should be command not found

ambiguous redirect
should be error, error code 1

sometimes takes many exits / ctrl Ds to exit minishell

FIXED env what

FIXED  cd--

export T=e E=c S=h L=o
$T$E$S$L
