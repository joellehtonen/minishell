PARSER
- do not ignore dollar sign with double quotes (HANDLE WHEN EXPANDING)

ERROR
- attach values/error codes to error messages. what numbers with which errors?

EXECUTE
- update / add freeing functions
- cd $HEY

SIGNALS: 
- in heredoc C quits heredoc and returns to input mode
- in input mode D exits bash and prints "exit"
- in heredoc D outputs this: bash: warning: here-document at line 1 delimited by end-of-file (wanted `echo')
	and exits heredoc
- in input mode \ does nothing, same in heredoc
- if we press Ctrl+C during here_doc, it doesn't close properly
- grep );$ and then Ctrl+C

if cd into directory and removing an upper directory, handle it somehow

echo "'$USER'" should expand, '"$USER"' should not

update error message to include latest token/char

if infinite loop before, then history not working and signals not working

SIGINT (ctrl c) exit code is 130

should we handle ; as a delimiter?

what if exit gets too long number as input
