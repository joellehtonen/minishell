PARSER
- do not ignore dollar sign with double quotes (HANDLE WHEN EXPANDING)
- recognize flags as FLAG token type

ERROR
- attach values/error codes to error messages. what numbers with which errors?

EXECUTE
- add heredoc and output-append (>>) functionality
- update based on FLAG token type
- update / add freeing functions

exit: command not found

SIGNALS: 
- in heredoc C quits heredoc and returns to input mode
- in input mode D exits bash and prints "exit"
- in heredoc D outputs this: bash: warning: here-document at line 1 delimited by end-of-file (wanted `echo')
	and exits heredoc
- in input mode \ does nothing, same in heredoc

if cd into directory and removing an upper directory, handle it somehow

echo "'$USER'" should expand, '"$USER"' should not

echo should also handle -nn, -nnnn etc.

what if input has many separators like |||| or >>>>, HANDLE only 1-2
BASH accepts ||>, ||<, ||>>, ||<<, ||<>
but not ||><

SIGINT (ctrl c) exit code is 130
