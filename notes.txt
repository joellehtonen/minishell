BUILTINS:
- export +=

SIGNALS: 
- in heredoc C quits heredoc and returns to input mode
- in input mode D exits bash and prints "exit"
- in heredoc D outputs this: bash: warning: here-document at line 1 delimited by end-of-file (wanted `echo')
	and exits heredoc
- in input mode \ does nothing, same in heredoc
- if we press Ctrl+C during here_doc, it doesn't close properly
- grep );$ and then Ctrl+C
- exit code for Ctrl+C (130?)

LEAKS:
- valgrind --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all --track-origins=yes --trace-children=yes --track-fds=yes --suppressions=readline.supp ./minishell

if cd into directory and removing an upper directory, handle it somehow

need to be able export or unset many at the same time

export | grep 'HOME 
this doesnt work

put env in alphabetical order?

< Makefile ""
this should be command not found

ambiguous redirect
should be error, error code 1

sometimes takes many exits / ctrl Ds to exit minishell
