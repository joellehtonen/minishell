EXECUTE
- update / add freeing functions
- is_directory - unified error printing?

SIGNALS: 
- in heredoc C quits heredoc and returns to input mode
- in input mode D exits bash and prints "exit"
- in heredoc D outputs this: bash: warning: here-document at line 1 delimited by end-of-file (wanted `echo')
	and exits heredoc
- in input mode \ does nothing, same in heredoc
- if we press Ctrl+C during here_doc, it doesn't close properly
- grep );$ and then Ctrl+C

if cd into directory and removing an upper directory, handle it somehow

if infinite loop before, then history not working and signals not working

what if exit gets too long number as input (if longer than 256, modulo 256)

need to be able export or unset many at the same time

export | grep 'HOME 
this doesnt work

put env in alphabetical order?

< Makefile ""
this should be command not found

ambiguous redirect
should be error, error code 1

sometimes takes many exits / ctrl Ds to exit minishell
